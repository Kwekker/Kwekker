I sure do like Infected Mushroom

Diminished Mind makes great bangers on SoundCloud. You should check him out.

Very hyped for Dune 2 in March. This is literally the third time they've pushed the date (very cringe).

"Nero's Day At Disneyland - A Lie Temporarily Becomes the Truth" is a banger, you should listen to it :).
